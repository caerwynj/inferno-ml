# ML library in limbo

A simple ndarray library inspired by python's ndarray, with some simple implementations
of linear regression and logistic regression from an ML training course
demonstrating gradient descent.

The original code was written in octave.

# Bugs
(These bugs don't seem to be occurring on the latest inferno64 distribution)
Something flakey with sprint("%f") and then doing toreal() on the string.  Breaks for some large numbers.
```
s := sprint("%f", 8073423872.0)
toreal(s, 10);
```
Also `sprint("%g")` crashes.
